# Comparison
A tool website used to compare the dimensions of two different products.

# Note
As this website develops, the promising features will be implemented. Currently, the focus is on delivering a program that can find the dimensions of a product first. The main challenge is figuring out how to find dimensions across different websites as each website may have a different class name.
