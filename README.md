# Comparison
A tool website used to compare the dimensions of two different products. By using BeautifulSoup, this program will scrape websites to find product dimensions. The user will be able to input two links for two different products and compare their sizes next to eachother.

# Note
As this website develops, the promising features will be implemented. Currently, the focus is on delivering a program that can find the dimensions of a product first. The main challenge is figuring out how to find dimensions across different websites as each website may have a different class name.
